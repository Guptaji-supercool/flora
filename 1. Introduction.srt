00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,540
Walk into Section 2 of The Complete Android develop because hopefully you've now got all of the free

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,610
stuff and it's time to start writing some code.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,050
So we'll begin by downloading Android studio.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,800
So what's the appropriate video for either Windows or Mac depending on your operating system.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,170
And then we'll take a tour of the Android studio interface and see how Android apps are put together.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,440
Then we'll start adding things like text views buttons and images to create a user interface for our

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,870
app.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,210
And we'll start writing code to make apps interactive.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,920
At the end of the section we'll make a currency converter app which will be your first big challenge

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,010
to put a hole up together in Android studio and run it right there on your machine in the emulator.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,200
At the same time I encourage you to download a copy of My Book House and $10000 while learning to code

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,630
and start jotting down a few ideas for apps that you would like to build.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,530
There's nothing like having a real idea for an app that you want to end up in Google Play to encourage

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,810
you and help you along as you're learning everything that comes in this course.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,460
Other than that I do enjoy the section and I'll see you at the beginning of the next one.
